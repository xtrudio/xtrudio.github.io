We believe that students learn best in a heterogeneous environment where they can compare what they know and think with the knowledge and ideas of adult scholars as well as with the knowledge and ideas of their classmates. Our very small middle school offers students the opportunity to grow and learn with classmates from diverse backgrounds within an engaging setting. Teachers accustomed to heterogeneous classrooms provide students a variety of individual and group learning experiences. Once a week, students meet in circles to strengthen the community of the classroom by learning more about each other, practicing active listening skills, playing group games, and exploring their social and emotional interests. As a 6-12 school, we also guarantee a seat in our high school for any middle school student interested in continuing at Park Slope Collegiate.",

Middle school students who continue on to our high school will take a blended suite of high school and college courses in a rigorous yet supportive program, compressing the time it takes to complete a high school diploma and up to the first two years of college. Simply put, our students can simultaneously earn a high school diploma and up to 73 transferable college credits tuition free from Brooklyn College enabling many of them to enter college with a sophomore or junior status at almost any CUNY, SUNY, or private university.",

Curriculum is aligned to the Common Core learning standards and is enhanced through the most current technologies and web programs. Our small setting allows students to feel secure and supported in their relationships with their teachers. Parents appreciate the small size of our school and the supportive environment that it provides their children. Our students are exposed to a variety of arts experiences throughout the day, and continue their studies in instrumental music, digital communication in our high school. Another important factor for parents is that students from our middle school are given priority to attend our high school.",

Each grade has a real-world, project-based theme through which all instruction is connected. Students like these projects because they provide opportunities to tackle important social issues, make a difference in their community, be creative, and have fun while they apply new skills. Our scholars benefit from rigorous, exploratory instruction that prepares them for the best high schools and provides the foundation needed for college and career. Our advisory program supports students' social and emotional needs, and guides them as they develop and act on Individual Goal Plans (IGPs) focused on academic and personal goals. We encourage parent involvement that goes beyond attending PTA meetings-family members are encouraged to join us on field trips, volunteer, participate in projects, and support our initiatives.",

We engage young learners by having them assume the roles of scientists, authors, researchers, engineers, and mathematicians thus preparing them to compete and succeed in high school, college, and beyond. Hands-on, real-life learning projects will guide instruction and engage our students. Through our partnership with St. John's University, students will have access to STEM-based resources and receive an early college experience. To facilitate the transition from elementary to middle school, we provide a daily advisory class that is grounded in mindfulness, positive behaviors, and goal-setting.",

Students choose an enrichment cohort and work side-by-side with their peers to dive deeply into their selected content area. Through guest speakers, field trips, and authentic learning tasks, students become experts in their selected field and work towards a culminating capstone project in senior year, during which they solve a self-identified problem or question and present their findings to the community. As a result, students grow as independent thinkers and apply what they learn to devise solutions that have a positive impact on their world. In addition, we offer opportunities for students to pursue their interests in sports, music, drama, clubs, foreign language, and writing both during and after school. Parents have a voice in school-based decisions via the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, fundraising, and our varied parent engagement events.",

        "OVERVIEW": "M.S. 907 opened its doors in Fall 2018. Imagine a place where your child’s creativity is tapped, their intellect is nurtured, their artistic talents are sharpened, and they are supported and happy. Welcome to M.S. 907 - a place for students to discover who they were meant to be! Our school combines standards-based academic instruction, exposure to the arts, and a projects-based approach to educate our students. And for those who exhibit exceptional academic or artistic aptitude, our Gifted and Talented program will challenge them so they can excel. Our model relies on student choice and exposure. Each semester sixth and seventh grade students will choose an arts elective (music, visual arts, creative writing, theater, and dance) to explore their skillsets. In their eighth grade year, students may narrow their focus to one specific arts connection to supplement their academics as they prepare for high school, college, and professional careers. Daily academic experiences will also be enriched for all students by authentic curricular connections to the arts. Picture it! As part of their creative arts or music elective, your child can learn to write poetry or songs to show the experiences of those they learn about in their humanities classes. Or, during dance elective, they can choreograph a jazz piece using their newfound math knowledge. As students grow at M.S. 907, they will build positive and enduring relationships with each other and the adults around them and develop their sense of self. They will also practice critical life skills such as persistence, flexible thinking, and innovation, habits of mind which will prepare them to be productive citizens in a 21st century global community. Every day our students will live our motto: Curiosity and creativity spark self-discovery!",

We make learning challenging. At the end of each semester, middle school students participate in week-long design competitions. Instead of regular classes, students work in groups of 12 to create projects such as fashion shows, restaurants, and newspapers. We are inclusive in how accept students into our school -- we do not screen. We are also inclusive in our programming within our walls -- we do not track.

Our goal is to see each child reach his or her academic and musical potential. Our vision is that all students will become lifelong learners and critical thinkers in our caring and respectful learning environment.

Each academy offers Honors/SP courses, talent courses, and classrooms infusing technology. Incoming sixth graders all take Robotics and Art talent courses. We are one of only two schools in NYC offering a full year of Robotics instruction for every sixth grader. We are a Software Engineering Program school offering computer programming/coding.

We are focused on fostering a culture of excellence in the acquisition of essential skills in all educational disciplines through a school-wide core curriculum that orchestrates diversity in learning styles and the needs, interests, and abilities of individual learners. We are founded on the belief that civic leadership is education in action for the good of all people within a global society. Our students will develop the skills they need to make informed decisions as independent critical thinkers who understand their democratic rights as private individuals and their civic responsibilities as public participants in a network of social and political communities. Ultimately, with family partnerships deeply embedded in our foundation, our students will become disciplined, courageous leaders who are inspired to make a difference in America's civic purpose.",

Because we have smaller academies, we are able to offer a personalized experience for all students with smaller teacher teams, an advisory program, a variety of celebrations and parent engagement activities, and dedicated teachers and counselors who know and connect with their students. Our high school guidance and preparation are outstanding: 9 out of 10 of all students are on track to graduate after 9th grade, and 24% of PACE's graduates were admitted to a specialized high school in 2017. Our active PA and School Leadership Team help us to grow and improve. Our 2017 Quality Review recognized our excellent school culture and high expectations.",

We have a wonderful attendance rate, higher than the city average, and we take students with perfect attendance on special field trips. So many extracurricular opportunities are available including: dance, music, visual arts, basketball, baseball, soccer, computer science, sign language, spoken word, chess, documentary film, and volleyball. We offer several programs on Saturdays through our CBO, Fordham University. Parents attend classes in English as a New Language and fitness. We are a community school and we always welcome the ideas of parents, students, and community members.",
