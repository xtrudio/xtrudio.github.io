<p id="p1"><strong>R1</strong><br>R1 districts are leafy, low-density neighborhoods of large, single-family detached homes on spacious lots. Resembling many suburbs, these districts are mapped in a few areas of the city, such as Todt Hill (R1-1) in Staten Island, Jamaica Estates (R1-2) in Queens, and Fieldston (R1-2) in the Bronx. R1-2A is mapped in Forest Hills in Queens.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three R1 districts. Although new homes in R1-1 districts must be on larger and wider lots than homes in R1-2 and R1-2A districts, generous yard requirements and high open space ratio (OSR) or lot coverage regulations preserve the open space that characterizes all R1 districts. The floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.5 and the sizeable required lot area tend to produce big, roomy houses. The maximum height of buildings in R1-1 and R1-2 districts is not fixed but is governed by a sky exposure plane;; contextual regulations in R1-2A districts produce buildings that maintain neighborhood scale and character with a maximum perimeter wall of 25 feet, a maximum building height of 35 feet and a front yard as deep as a neighboring yard. Auto ownership rates are high and, as in other lower-density districts which are often distant from mass transit, one off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit.></p>

<p id="p2"><strong>R2</strong><br>Residential development in R2 districts is limited exclusively to single-family detached houses. Floral Park in Queens, parts of City Island and Riverdale in the Bronx, and Westerleigh on Staten Island’s north shore are typical R2 districts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smaller lot area and lot width requirements in R2 districts allow a higher density than in R1 districts, although the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.5 is the same. The minimum lot width is 40 feet, compared to 60 and 100 feet in R1 districts. The maximum height of buildings is not fixed but is governed by a sky exposure plane. As in other lower-density residence districts, one off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit.</p>
<p id="p3"><strong>R3-1</strong><br>R3-1 contextual districts are the lowest density districts that allow semi-detached one- and two-family residences, as well as detached homes. R3-1 districts generally follow existing patterns of development in the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and south Brooklyn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In R3-1 districts, the minimum lot width for detached houses is 40 feet; semi-detached buildings must be on zoning lots that are at least 18 feet wide. For both detached and semi-detached houses, the maximum lot coverage is 35% and the 0.5 floor area ratio (FAR) may be increased by an attic allowance of up to 20% for the inclusion of space beneath a pitched roof. The perimeter wall may rise to 21 feet before sloping or being set back to a maximum building height of 35 feet. The front yard must be at least 15 feet deep. Two side yards with a minimum combined width of 13 feet are required for a detached residence; one eight foot side yard is required for each semi-detached residence. All parking must be located in the side or rear yard or in the garage. An in-house garage is permitted in a semi-detached house, or in a detached house if the lot is 40 feet or wider. One off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit.<br><br><strong>R3-2</strong><br></p>
<p id="p4"><strong>R4</strong><br> – a tax lot connecting two streets, with frontage on both
streets. Note that a lot with two frontages is not necessarily a through lot. For example, an L-shaped lot with two frontages is considered an inside lot.</p>
<p id="p5"><strong>R5</strong><br> – a tax lot with frontage on only one street. This value comes
from CAMA, but is only assigned in PLUTO if CAMA has no other lot types for the tax lot.</p>
<p id="p6"><strong>R6</strong><br> – a tax lot that has no street frontage.</p>
<p id="p7"><strong>R7</strong><br> – a tax lot that is entirely surrounded by water.</p>
<p id="p8"><strong>R8</strong><br> – a tax lot that is too narrow to accommodate a building.
The lot is usually 12 feet or less in width.</p>
