<p id="p1"><strong>R1</strong><br>R1 districts are leafy, low-density neighborhoods of large, single-family detached homes on spacious lots. Resembling many suburbs, these districts are mapped in a few areas of the city, such as Todt Hill (R1-1) in Staten Island, Jamaica Estates (R1-2) in Queens, and Fieldston (R1-2) in the Bronx. R1-2A is mapped in Forest Hills in Queens.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three R1 districts. Although new homes in R1-1 districts must be on larger and wider lots than homes in R1-2 and R1-2A districts, generous yard requirements and high open space ratio (OSR) or lot coverage regulations preserve the open space that characterizes all R1 districts. The floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.5 and the sizeable required lot area tend to produce big, roomy houses. The maximum height of buildings in R1-1 and R1-2 districts is not fixed but is governed by a sky exposure plane;; contextual regulations in R1-2A districts produce buildings that maintain neighborhood scale and character with a maximum perimeter wall of 25 feet, a maximum building height of 35 feet and a front yard as deep as a neighboring yard. Auto ownership rates are high and, as in other lower-density districts which are often distant from mass transit, one off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit.></p>

<p id="p2"><strong>R2</strong><br>Residential development in R2 districts is limited exclusively to single-family detached houses. Floral Park in Queens, parts of City Island and Riverdale in the Bronx, and Westerleigh on Staten Island’s north shore are typical R2 districts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smaller lot area and lot width requirements in R2 districts allow a higher density than in R1 districts, although the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.5 is the same. The minimum lot width is 40 feet, compared to 60 and 100 feet in R1 districts. The maximum height of buildings is not fixed but is governed by a sky exposure plane. As in other lower-density residence districts, one off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit.</p>
<p id="p3"><strong>R3-1</strong><br>R3-1 contextual districts are the lowest density districts that allow semi-detached one- and two-family residences, as well as detached homes. R3-1 districts generally follow existing patterns of development in the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and south Brooklyn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In R3-1 districts, the minimum lot width for detached houses is 40 feet; semi-detached buildings must be on zoning lots that are at least 18 feet wide. For both detached and semi-detached houses, the maximum lot coverage is 35% and the 0.5 floor area ratio (FAR) may be increased by an attic allowance of up to 20% for the inclusion of space beneath a pitched roof. The perimeter wall may rise to 21 feet before sloping or being set back to a maximum building height of 35 feet. The front yard must be at least 15 feet deep. Two side yards with a minimum combined width of 13 feet are required for a detached residence; one eight foot side yard is required for each semi-detached residence. All parking must be located in the side or rear yard or in the garage. An in-house garage is permitted in a semi-detached house, or in a detached house if the lot is 40 feet or wider. One off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit.<br><br><strong>R3-2</strong><br>R3-2 districts are general residence districts that allow a variety of housing types, including low-rise attached houses, small multi­family apartment houses, and detached and semi-detached one- and two-family residences. It is the lowest density zoning district in which multiple dwellings are permitted. Because of their flexibility, R3-2 districts are mapped widely in all boroughs except Manhattan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 0.5 floor area ratio (FAR) may be increased by an attic allowance of up to 20% for the inclusion of space beneath a pitched roof. The perimeter wall may rise to 21 feet before sloping or being set back to a maximum building height of 35 feet. Lots with detached homes must be at least 40 feet wide; if occupied by semi-detached and attached buildings, lots must be at least 18 feet wide. The maximum street wall length for a building on a zoning lot is 125 feet. The maximum lot coverage of any residence is 35%. Front yards must be at least 15 feet deep. Cars may park in the side or rear yard, in the garage or in the front yard within the side lot ribbon; parking is also allowed within the front yard when the lot is wider than 35 feet. One off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit. However, requirements are lower for income-restricted housing units (IRHU) and are further modified within the Transit Zone.</p>
<p id="p4"><strong>R4</strong><br>R4 districts allow all types of ­housing at a slightly higher density than permit­ted in R3-2 districts. The floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.75, plus an attic allowance of up to 20% for inclusion of space under the pitched roof common to these districts, ­usually produces buildings with three stories instead of the two-story homes characteristic of R3 districts. Much of the residential development in North Corona in Queens and Arden Heights in Staten Island is typical of R4 districts.

To accommodate a potential third floor beneath a pitched roof, the perimeter wall in R4 districts may rise to 25 feet before being set back to the maximum building height of 35 feet. Front yards must be 10 feet deep or, if deeper, a minimum of 18 feet to provide sufficient space for on-site parking. Cars may park in the side or rear yard, in the garage or in the front yard within the side lot ribbon; the driveway must be within the side lot ribbon unless the lot is wider than 35 feet. Detached houses must have two side yards that total at least 13 feet and each one must be at least five feet wide. Semi-detached buildings need one side yard with a minimum width of eight feet. The maximum street wall length for a building on a single zoning lot is 185 feet. One off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit. However, requirements are lower for income-restricted housing units (IRHU) and are further modified within the Transit Zone.</p>

<p id="p5"><strong>R5</strong><br>R5 districts allow a variety of housing at a higher density than permitted in R3-2 and R4 districts. The floor area ratio (FAR) of 1.25 typically produces three-and four-story attached houses and small apartment houses. With a height limit of 40 feet, R5 districts provide a transition between lower- and higher-density neighborhoods and are widely mapped in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Portions of Windsor Terrace and Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn are R5 districts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure compatibility with neighborhood scale, the maximum street wallheight of a new building is 30 feet and the maximum building height is 40 feet. Above a height of 30 feet, a setback of 15 feet is required from the street wall of the building; in addition, any portion of the building that exceeds a height of 33 feet must be set back from a rear or side yard line. Detached houses must have two side yards that total at least 13 feet, each with a minimum width of five feet. Semi-detached houses need one eight foot wide side yard. Apartment houses need two side yards, each at least eight feet wide. Front yards must be 10 feet deep or, if deeper, a minimum of 18 feet to prevent cars parked on-site from protruding onto the sidewalk. Cars may park in the side or rear yard, in the garage or in the front yard within the side lot ribbon; parking is also allowed within the front yard when the lot is wider than 35 feet. Off-street parking is required for 85% of the dwelling units in the building, but requirements are lower for income-restricted housing units (IRHU) and are further modified within the Transit Zone<br><br><strong>R5 Infill</strong><br>On a block entirely within an R5 district (without a suffix), optional regulations may be used to develop infill housing in predominately built-up areas. Infill regulations may be used if at least 50% of the area of the block is occupied by zoning lots developed with buildings, and the lot does not exceed 1.5 acres (65,340 sq ft). However, infill regulations may not be used to redevelop a lot occupied by a one- or two-family detached or semi-detached house unless the blockfront is predominantly developed with attached or multi-family housing, or commercial or manufacturing uses. Infill regulations can be found in the definition of predominantly built-up areas in Section 12-10 of the Zoning Resolution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sites that qualify for infill housing, the higher floor area ratio (FAR) of 1.65 and more relaxed parking requirements permit developments with greater bulk and more dwelling units than are otherwise permitted in R5 districts; infill regulations typically produce three-story buildings with three dwelling units and two parking spaces—one in a ground-floor garage and the other in the driveway. Infill regulations can also produce small apartment buildings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that infill housing generally conforms to existing neighborhood scale, height and setback regulations for R5 infill housing are the same as for R5B districts. The maximum street wall length for a building on a single zoning lot is 185 feet. Front yards must be at least 18 feet deep to prevent cars parked in the front driveway from protruding onto the sidewalk. Off-street parking must be provided for at least two-thirds of the dwelling units.<br><br><strong>R5A</strong><br>R5A contextual districts, mapped in the northeast Bronx neighborhoods of Olinville and Williamsbridge, permit only one- and two-family detached residences with a maximum 1.1floor area ratio (FAR). Similar to R4A districts, R5A districts are characterized by houses with two stories and an attic beneath a pitched roof, but the greater FAR and higher perimeter wall allow for somewhat larger buildings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The perimeter wall of a house may rise to 25 feet in R5A districts (compared to 21 feet in R4A districts) before sloping or being set back to the maximum building height of 35 feet. The minimum lot width is 30 feet. The amount of required open space is governed by yard requirements that are the same as those in R4A districts: a front yard must be at least as deep as an adjacent front yard and at least 10 feet deep but it need not exceed a depth of 20 feet; a 30 foot deep rear yard; and two side yards that total at least 10 feet, each with a minimum width of two feet. Cars may park in the side or rear yard; parking is also allowed within the front yard when the lot is wider than 35 feet. An in-house garage is permitted if the lot is at least 35 feet wide. One off-street parking space is required for each dwelling unit.</p>
<p id="p6"><strong>R6</strong><br>R6 zoning districts are widely mapped in built-up, medium-density areas in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The character of R6 districts can range from neighborhoods with a diverse mix of building types and heights to large-scale “tower in the park” developments such as Ravenswood in Queens and Homecrest in Brooklyn. Developers can choose between two sets of bulk regulations. Standard height factor regulations, introduced in 1961, produce small multi-family buildings on small zoning lots and, on larger lots, tall buildings that are set back from the street. Optional Quality Housing regulations produce high lot coverage buildings within height limits that often reflect the scale of older, pre-1961 apartment buildings in the neighborhood.</p>
<p id="p7"><strong>R7</strong><br>R7 districts are medium-density apartment house districts mapped in much of the Bronx as well as the Upper West Side in Manhattan and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn. The height factor regulations for R7 districts encourage lower apartment buildings on smaller zoning lots and, on larger lots, taller buildings with less lot coverage. As an alternative, developers may choose the optional Quality Housing regulations to build lower buildings with greater lot coverage.

Regulations for residential development in R7-1 and R7-2 districts are essentially the same except that R7-2 districts, which are mapped primarily in upper Manhattan, have lower parking requirements.</p>
<p id="p8"><strong>R8</strong><br>Apartment buildings in R8 districts can range from mid-rise, eight- to ten-story buildings to much taller buildings set back from the street on large zoning lots. This high density residential district is mapped along the Grand Concourse in the Bronx and on the edge of Brooklyn Heights. R8 districts are also widely mapped in Manhattan neighborhoods, such as Washington Heights. New buildings in R8 districts may be developed under either height factor regulations or the optional Quality Housing regulations that often reflect the older, pre-1961 neighborhood streetscape.</p>
<p id="p9"><strong>R9</strong><br>R9 districts, which are mapped along several major thoroughfares in Manhattan, such as West 96th Street, new buildings can be developed under height factor regulations or the optional Quality Housing regulations as in R6 through R8 districts. The optional Quality Housing regulations in R9 districts are the same as the R9A regulations. Designed in part for institutional purposes (mainly hospitals), most R9 height factor buildings are developed pursuant to the tower rules, which are applicable only in the city’s higher-density areas, and commercial districts with an R9 residential district equivalent (C1‑8, C2-7 and C6-3).
<br><br><strong>R9 Height Factor/Tower Regulations</strong><br>
The floor area ratio (FAR) for height ­factor/tower buildings ranges from 0.99 to 7.52 and the open space ratio (OSR) from 1.0 to 9.0. As in other height factor districts, a taller building can usually be developed by providing more open space. Under the tower rules, however, buildings on both wide and narrow streets are permitted to penetrate the sky exposure plane. In the diagram, for example, buildings that front on a wide street must have a contextual street wall of 60 to 85 feet with a tower above (tower-on-a-base). The height of the tower is controlled by a minimum lot coverage requirement and a rule that at least 55% of the floor area on the zoning lot be located below a height of 150 feet. For buildings with only narrow street frontage, a contextual base is not required and towers are permitted, provided they are set back from the street line at least 15 feet.

Higher maximum FAR are available for buildings participating in the Inclusionary Housing Program or that provide certain senior facilities.

Off-street parking is generally required for 40 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower for income-restricted housing units (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as within the Transit Zone and the Manhattan Core, or for lots less than 15,000 square feet. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking spaces are required or if the zoning lot is 10,000 square feet or less.</p>
<p id="p10"><strong>R10</strong><br>R10 districts are mapped along portions of Fifth and Park Avenues in Manhattan; however, most buildings that conform to the R10 building envelope are found in commercial districts with a residential district equivalent of R10, the highest residential density in the city. Much of Midtown, Lower Manhattan and major avenues in Manhattan, as well as parts of Downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City, are mapped at R10 density. The floor area ratio (FAR) is 10.0. Developers may choose between Quality Housing regulations or tower regulations; height factor regulations are not applicable.

Higher maximum FAR and heights are available for buildings participating in the Inclusionary Housing Program or that provide certain senior facilities.

Off-street parking is generally required for 40 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower for income-restricted housing units (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as within the Transit Zone and the Manhattan Core, or for lots less than 15,000 square feet. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking spaces are required or if the zoning lot is 10,000 square feet or less.</p>
